1.1 An Introduction to this Subject 
This   subject introduces students   to   social   work, its common values, different perspectives, and current debates. Diverse   constructions   of   social   work   embedded   in different   knowledge   systems   and   models   will   be   explored. Social   work   perspectives   in   a   multicultural   cosmopolitan Australia   will   be   analysed   including,   amongst   others,   Indigenous   social   work, White   western   social   work,   Pacific   social   work, Afrocentric   social   work, memorial   social   work,   Brazilian   social work,   etc. An   overview   of the   changing   Australian   socio-political   environment,   policy   and   practice   context will   be   explored   and   the   role   of   social   work   in   the   different   fields   of   practice   analysed,   to   locate   strategies   for   generating   positive   and   creative   social   change. 
1.2 What is Expected of You 
Study Load A   student   is   expected   to   study   an   hour   per   credit   point   a   week. For   example   a   10   credit   point   subject   would   require
10   hours   of   study   per   week.   This   time   includes   the   time   spent   within   classes   during   lectures,   tutorials   or   practicals.Note for Summer Terms:    As Summer subjects deliver the same content and classes over a shorter period of time, the subjects are run in a more intensive mode. Regardless of the delivery mode, the study hours for each subject in Summer will be around 30 hours. 
Attendance 
It   is   strongly   recommended   that   students   attend   all   scheduled   learning   activities   to   support   their   learning.
Approach to Learning
In   this   subject,   we   are   committed   to   a   decolonised   approach   to   learning   and   teaching.   The   subject   privileges   diverse   knowledge   traditions   derived   from   diverse   backgrounds   in   a   multicultural   cosmopolitan   Australia   and   beyond. Stu-dents   are   positioned   as   both   learners   and   teachers:    students   come   from   diverse   cultural backgrounds,   have   diverse   experiences   (professional      personal)   and   therefore   each   one   will   be   expected   to   teach   and   also   learn   from   others.The   subject   is   delivered   through   weekly   workshops   and   online   lecture   recordings. Guest lecturers   will   also   be   inter-   viewed   and   recordings   shared   online   to   enhance   learning   and   teaching.   You   are   expected   to   listen   to   these   recordings   before   the   workshops   which   are   held   face-to-face.   Weekly   workshops   are   meant   for   discussions,   this   means   students   must   come   when   they have listened   to   and read pre-assigned   weekly learning    materials   for   active participation   in   discussions.
Online Learning Requirements Subject   materials   will   be   made   available   on   the   subject’s   vUWS   (E-Learning)   site (https://vuws.westernsydney.edu. au/).   You   are expected to consult vUWS   at   least twice   a   week,   as   all   subject   announcements   will   be   made   via   vUWS.   Teaching   and   learning   materials   will   be   regularly   updated   and   posted   online   by   the   teaching   team.

Feedback on Assessment Feedback   is   an   important   part   of the   learning   process   that   can   improve   your   progress   towards   achieving   the   learning   outcomes. Feedback   is   any   written   or   spoken   response   made   in   relation   to   academic   work   such   as   an   assessment   task,   a   performance   or   product. It   can be   given   to   you   by   a   teacher,   an   external   assessor   or   student   peer,   and   may   be   given   individually   or   to   a   group   of   students. As   a   Western   Sydney   University   student,   it   is   your   responsibility   to   seek   out   and   act   on   feedback   that   is   provided   to   you   as   a   resource   to   further   your   learning.
